# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Fatigue Tracker

A data-driven self-tracking case study to monitor fatigue, recovery, and performance using wearable sensor data.

---

## 📚 Overview

This project analyzes fitness tracker data to study the relationships between daily activity, sleep, heart rate variability (HRV), and recovery metrics. It combines time series analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to uncover how lifestyle factors impact recovery and performance over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 Perform time series analysis on wearable fitness data (steps, sleep, HRV, calories burned)
- 🔍 Identify patterns and correlations between physical activity, sleep habits, and recovery trends
- 🤖 Build a classification model to predict low vs. optimal recovery days
- 🧠 Apply SHAP for explainable AI to interpret key features driving model predictions
