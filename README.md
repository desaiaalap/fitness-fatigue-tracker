Fitness Fatigue Tracker Project
📚 Overview
This project analyzes fitness tracker data to study the relationships between daily activity, sleep, heart rate variability (HRV), and recovery metrics.
It applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling techniques to uncover how lifestyle factors affect recovery and performance over time.

🎯 Goals
Perform time series analysis on wearable fitness data (Steps, Sleep, HRV, Calories Burned).

Identify correlations between physical activity, sleep patterns, and recovery trends.

Build a machine learning model to classify low vs. optimal recovery days.

Use explainable AI (SHAP) to understand the most important features influencing recovery.
